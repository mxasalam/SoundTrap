# Solution: SoundTrap

SoundTrap is an IoT-based device designed to address urban noise pollution by automating noise detection, offender identification, and e-challan generation. Unlike manual or experimental approaches, SoundTrap offers a scalable, implementable solution.

## **How SoundTrap Works**
1. **Noise Detection**:
   - Captures ambient noise using a sound level meter integrated into the device.
   - Measures decibel levels and compares them against predefined thresholds for different zones.

2. **Offender Identification**:
   - Records a short video of law-breaking vehicles exceeding noise thresholds.
   - Extracts details like decibel levels, timestamps, and location.

3. **Automated Reporting**:
   - Transmits video evidence and offender details to traffic authorities for processing and penalization.

## **Key Features of SoundTrap**
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 
   - Detects violations in residential, schooling, and hospital areas.
- **Data Accuracy**:
   - Differentiates between ambient noise and vehicular noise.
   - Records precise decibel levels and timestamps.
- **Automation**:
   - Reduces manual intervention by integrating with existing traffic monitoring systems.
- **Scalability**:
   - Hardware and software can be expanded for additional applications, such as siren detection.
