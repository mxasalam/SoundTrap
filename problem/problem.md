# Problem: Urban Noise Pollution

Noise pollution in urban environments is a growing public health challenge, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and increasing vehicular traffic. Despite existing regulations, enforcement remains inefficient.

## **Key Challenges**
1. **Vehicular Noise Pollution**:
   - Modified silencers, aftermarket horns, and high-speed traffic produce noise levels exceeding permissible limits.
   - Noise often exceeds 80 dB in residential areas, 75 dB in hospital zones, and 85 dB in school zones.

2. **Manual Monitoring Limitations**:
   - Current enforcement relies on handheld sound-level meters, requiring significant manual effort.
   - Lawbreakers are often caught inconsistently due to resource constraints.

3. **Health Implications**:
   - Prolonged exposure to noise leads to direct effects like hearing loss and indirect effects like cardiovascular stress, sleep disturbances, and reduced productivity.

## **Evidence of the Problem**
- **Hyderabad Statistics**:
   - Average noise levels exceed 80 dB in major commercial zones like Panjagutta, Paradise Junction, and Charminar.
   - Sensitive areas, such as hospitals and schools, record noise levels well above prescribed limits of 50 dB.

- **WHO Guidelines**:
   - Recommends night noise levels below 40 dB for good sleep quality.
   - Exposure to noise above 60 dB can cause severe health issues.

## **The Need for Automation**
Manual approaches are inefficient, and experimental solutions like "The Punishing Signal" lack scalability. An automated, data-driven solution like SoundTrap is essential for enforcing noise pollution regulations effectively.
