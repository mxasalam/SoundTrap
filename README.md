# SoundTrap: Noise Pollution Mitigation Model for Loud Vehicles

## Overview
SoundTrap is an IoT-based device designed to address urban noise pollution caused by vehicular traffic. The device captures sound data, differentiates between public and vehicular noise, and automatically penalizes offenders exceeding noise thresholds. This project focuses on enhancing noise regulation in sensitive and residential areas, promoting peaceful environments.

## Features
- Automated noise monitoring and offender identification.
- Scalability for hardware and software enhancements.
- Integration with traffic systems for real-time data processing.

## Key Statistics
- Target noise levels: <80 dB (Residential), <75 dB (Hospitals), <85 dB (Schools).
- Current Market Value: $806.5 million, with a 4.1% CAGR.
